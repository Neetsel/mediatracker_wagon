Media-trackr is a Ruby On Rails app created during our Web Development training at Le Wagon.

It allows to create collections that gathers the media you've played, read or watched. 

You can also ask for recommendations to our chatbot based on Open AI. 

The app is currently optimized for mobile but will be made fully responsive.

We used 3 different APIs to gather these different media.
- OMDB for movies
- Open Library for books
- IGDB for games

Gems used:
- devise
- faraday
- ruby_llm
- bootstrap
- font awesome
...

In the coming months, multiple features will be added:
- responsive interface
- backend jobs to handle api calls
- ability to specify on which date medias where consumed
- search for other users and look at their profile
- possibility to plan viewing or play sessions with other users
- more medias/events such as concerts
